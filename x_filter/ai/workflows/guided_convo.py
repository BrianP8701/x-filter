- Use the outer list to compile groups of keywords that, when searched together, should be considered as separate search queries (OR logic).
- Within each group, list keywords that must all be present in a search result (AND logic).
Consider this user prompt as an example:
"I'm specifically looking for tweets that deliver insights into new methods in RAG, addressing new challenges. I'm interested in new chunking methods in RAG, top vector databases, and models fine-tuned for RAG. Additionally, I'm keen on methods that go beyond vector similarity, utilizing metadata, descriptions, or an LLM to navigate through a structured data system. A system that autonomously organizes arbitrary data into a structured file system, with descriptive labeling and LLM-based search capabilities, would be of particular interest."
A simplistic keyword grouping like [['RAG'], ['solve', 'new problems'], ['file structure']] is inadequate. Such broad terms will yield an overwhelming number of irrelevant tweets. The goal is to craft keyword groups that are both comprehensive and precise, ensuring relevance without overlooking potential insights. Aim for specificity and thoughtful combinations that capture the essence of the user's request.
A more effective approach might include:
[["chunking", "RAG"], ["models", "finetuned", "RAG"], ["file structure", "LLM", "RAG"], ["vector databases", "state of the art", "RAG"], ["metadata", "data organization", "LLM"]].
In addition, you can see this example is quite a specific field, so you should go on to create many more combinations of keywords. In the other hand, if the user's request is by default more broad, you can create less combinations of keywords."""
