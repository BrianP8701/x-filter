Id be particularly fascinated to see someone working on a system that takes an arbitrary data, and organizes it into a file structure autonomously, labeling folders with descripitons organizing it etc, and then to be able to have an LLM search it. \n"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "If you like this prompt and are ready to move on, say 'yes'.

This step is crucial for honing in on the most relevant search results. Here\'s how to structure the data:\n- Use the outer list to compile groups of keywords that, when searched together, should be considered as separate search queries (OR logic).\n- Within each group, list keywords that must all be present in a search result (AND logic).\nConsider this user prompt as an example:\n"I\'m specifically looking for tweets that deliver insights into new methods in RAG, addressing new challenges. I\'m interested in new chunking methods in RAG, top vector databases, and models fine-tuned for RAG. Additionally, I\'m keen on methods that go beyond vector similarity, utilizing metadata, descriptions, or an LLM to navigate through a structured data system. A system that autonomously organizes arbitrary data into a structured file system, with descriptive labeling and LLM-based search capabilities, would be of particular interest."\nA simplistic keyword grouping like [[\'RAG\'], [\'solve\', \'new problems\'], [\'file structure\']] is inadequate. Such broad terms will yield an overwhelming number of irrelevant tweets. The goal is to craft keyword groups that are both comprehensive and precise, ensuring relevance without overlooking potential insights. Aim for specificity and thoughtful combinations that capture the essence of the user\'s request.\nA more effective approach might include:\n[["chunking", "RAG"], ["models", "finetuned", "RAG"], ["file structure", "LLM", "RAG"], ["vector databases", "state of the art", "RAG"], ["metadata", "data organization", "LLM"]].\nIn addition, you can see this example is quite a specific field, so you should go on to create many more combinations of keywords.

	{'role': 'system', 'content': 'Your task is to distill keyword groups from the user\'s prompt with precision, populating the provided object effectively. This step is crucial for honing in on the most relevant search results. Here\'s how to structure the data:\n- Use the outer list to compile groups of keywords that, when searched together, should be considered as separate search queries (OR logic).\n- Within each group, list keywords that must all be present in a search result (AND logic).\nConsider this user prompt as an example:\n"I\'m specifically looking for tweets that deliver insights into new methods in RAG, addressing new challenges. I\'m interested in new chunking methods in RAG, top vector databases, and models fine-tuned for RAG. Additionally, I\'m keen on methods that go beyond vector similarity, utilizing metadata, descriptions, or an LLM to navigate through a structured data system. A system that autonomously organizes arbitrary data into a structured file system, with descriptive labeling and LLM-based search capabilities, would be of particular interest."\nA simplistic keyword grouping like [[\'RAG\'], [\'solve\', \'new problems\'], [\'file structure\']] is inadequate. Such broad terms will yield an overwhelming number of irrelevant tweets. The goal is to craft keyword groups that are both comprehensive and precise, ensuring relevance without overlooking potential insights. Aim for specificity and thoughtful combinations that capture the essence of the user\'s request.\nA more effective approach might include:\n[["chunking", "RAG"], ["models", "finetuned", "RAG"], ["file structure", "LLM", "RAG"], ["vector databases", "state of the art", "RAG"], ["metadata", "data organization", "LLM"]].\nIn addition, you can see this example is quite a specific field, so you should go on to create many more combinations of keywords. In the other hand, if the user\'s request is by default more broad, you can create less combinations of keywords.'}

This step is crucial for honing in on the most relevant search results. Here\'s how to structure the data:\n- Use the outer list to compile groups of keywords that, when searched together, should be considered as separate search queries (OR logic).\n- Within each group, list keywords that must all be present in a search result (AND logic).\nConsider this user prompt as an example:\n"I\'m specifically looking for tweets that deliver insights into new methods in RAG, addressing new challenges. I\'m interested in new chunking methods in RAG, top vector databases, and models fine-tuned for RAG. Additionally, I\'m keen on methods that go beyond vector similarity, utilizing metadata, descriptions, or an LLM to navigate through a structured data system. A system that autonomously organizes arbitrary data into a structured file system, with descriptive labeling and LLM-based search capabilities, would be of particular interest."\nA simplistic keyword grouping like [[\'RAG\'], [\'solve\', \'new problems\'], [\'file structure\']] is inadequate. Such broad terms will yield an overwhelming number of irrelevant tweets. The goal is to craft keyword groups that are both comprehensive and precise, ensuring relevance without overlooking potential insights. Aim for specificity and thoughtful combinations that capture the essence of the user\'s request.\nA more effective approach might include:\n[["chunking", "RAG"], ["models", "finetuned", "RAG"], ["file structure", "LLM", "RAG"], ["vector databases", "state of the art", "RAG"], ["metadata", "data organization", "LLM"]].\nIn addition, you can see this example is quite a specific field, so you should go on to create many more combinations of keywords. In the other hand, if the user\'s request is by default more broad, you can create less combinations of keywords.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "Search for tweets discussing 'Agentic RAG' (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with a focus on systems that can autonomously take in data, organize it into a file structure or tree, and have capabilities to update, search, and optimize it.

If they haven't fill out the 'message' field."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'id like reports'}], 'model': 'gpt-4-1106-preview', 'seed': 69, 'temperature': 0.0, 'tool_choice': {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'Stage1'}}, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'Stage1', 'description': 'Determine what the FilterTarget.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'FilterTarget': {'enum': ['users', 'tweets', 'reports'], 'title': 'FilterTarget', 'type': 'string'}}, 'properties': {'filter_target': {'anyOf': [{'$ref': '#/$defs/FilterTarget'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'default': None}, 'message': {'title': 'Message', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['message'], 'type': 'object'}}}]}}

This step is crucial for honing in on the most relevant search results. Here\'s how to structure the data:\n- Use the outer list to compile groups of keywords that, when searched together, should be considered as separate search queries (OR logic).\n- Within each group, list keywords that must all be present in a search result (AND logic).\nConsider this user prompt as an example:\n"I\'m specifically looking for tweets that deliver insights into new methods in RAG, addressing new challenges. I\'m interested in new chunking methods in RAG, top vector databases, and models fine-tuned for RAG. Additionally, I\'m keen on methods that go beyond vector similarity, utilizing metadata, descriptions, or an LLM to navigate through a structured data system. A system that autonomously organizes arbitrary data into a structured file system, with descriptive labeling and LLM-based search capabilities, would be of particular interest."\nA simplistic keyword grouping like [[\'RAG\'], [\'solve\', \'new problems\'], [\'file structure\']] is inadequate. Such broad terms will yield an overwhelming number of irrelevant tweets. The goal is to craft keyword groups that are both comprehensive and precise, ensuring relevance without overlooking potential insights. Aim for specificity and thoughtful combinations that capture the essence of the user\'s request.\nA more effective approach might include:\n[["chunking", "RAG"], ["models", "finetuned", "RAG"], ["file structure", "LLM", "RAG"], ["vector databases", "state of the art", "RAG"], ["metadata", "data organization", "LLM"]].\nIn addition, you can see this example is quite a specific field, so you should go on to create many more combinations of keywords. In the other hand, if the user\'s request is by default more broad, you can create less combinations of keywords.'}

Interest is particularly high in systems that can autonomously organize arbitrary data into a file structure, label folders with descriptions, and enable an LLM to search within this structured data.."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Tweet: RT @LangChainAI: ✂️But, How is Chunking Done?\n\nTo create Better RAG applications, you need to know how to split or chunk the documents so y…'}], 'model': 'gpt-4-1106-preview', 'seed': 69, 'temperature': 0.0, 'tool_choice': {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'CreateTweetReport'}}, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'CreateTweetReport', 'description': 'Correctly extracted `CreateTweetReport` with all the required parameters with correct types', 'parameters': {'properties': {'report': {'description': "Write this tweet's report here.", 'title': 'Report', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['report'], 'type': 'object'}}}]}}
