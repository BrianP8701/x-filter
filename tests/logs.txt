Im already familiar with lots of methods. Most modern RAG consists of indexing data into a vector database and doing similarity search over this, with tons of optimizations happening all the time. for example, data needs to be extracted and then also "chunked" which means split into smaller pieces. this sounds simple but is actually complex. with code you can chunk by abstract syntax tree parsing, splitting by functions or classes. but in a book or something its not clear. you can split by empty line, but that doesent always work because maybe you seperated two closely related paragraphs etc. i have not seen a solution to this, and i suspect there wont be a general chunking method without agents. in addition, given a question doing vector similarity doesent always point to the related answer. its actually stupid to search docs with vector similarity using a question. you want to navigate the sections of the documentation to get to ur answer. i think vector similarity has its uses but is not a scalable solution. i think the solution is to take a very agentic approach to rag. for example. you have a memory metadata tree. you first insert a repository of code and documentation into this tree. every node in the tree has a description explaining what that node is. when a question comes in an agent will start from the root of the tree and look at descriptions of child nodes to decide what node to navigate to. now in this case itll land on the documentation or repository node. but it cant retrieve that, now it begins dynamizally breaking up the data on the spot. different types of data have diiferent actions we can perform on them to break them up. we can do abstract syntax tree parsing to find something we want in the repo, keyword search in the docs or repo, or vector similarity on the docs. the agent searches the nodes for the answer and returns it. now those nodes are partially broken up and all the actions it performed searching are saved as child nodes with edges being the action performed to get that child node. in this manner the data is intelligently chunked. I think that this is a scalable solution. trees are O(logn). please find and generate weekly reports for me on anything close to this topic. find people who are working on something similar. and not just people talking about it but people who achieve results and that have genuine insights. im not looking for people who preach abt how important smth is, im looking for reports that share real insights and solutions in this problem space as well as people who are working on it'

2024-04-20 14:52:50,419 - INFO - Adding message to conversation: Im very interested in RAG. Im already familiar with lots of methods. Most modern RAG consists of indexing data into a vector database and doing similarity search over this, with tons of optimizations happening all the time. for example, data needs to be extracted and then also "chunked" which means split into smaller pieces. this sounds simple but is actually complex. with code you can chunk by abstract syntax tree parsing, splitting by functions or classes. but in a book or something its not clear. you can split by empty line, but that doesent always work because maybe you seperated two closely related paragraphs etc. i have not seen a solution to this, and i suspect there wont be a general chunking method without agents. in addition, given a question doing vector similarity doesent always point to the related answer. its actually stupid to search docs with vector similarity using a question. you want to navigate the sections of the documentation to get to ur answer. i think vector similarity has its uses but is not a scalable solution. i think the solution is to take a very agentic approach to rag. for example. you have a memory metadata tree. you first insert a repository of code and documentation into this tree. every node in the tree has a description explaining what that node is. when a question comes in an agent will start from the root of the tree and look at descriptions of child nodes to decide what node to navigate to. now in this case itll land on the documentation or repository node. but it cant retrieve that, now it begins dynamizally breaking up the data on the spot. different types of data have diiferent actions we can perform on them to break them up. we can do abstract syntax tree parsing to find something we want in the repo, keyword search in the docs or repo, or vector similarity on the docs. the agent searches the nodes for the answer and returns it. now those nodes are partially broken up and all the actions it performed searching are saved as child nodes with edges being the action performed to get that child node. in this manner the data is intelligently chunked. I think that this is a scalable solution. trees are O(logn). please find and generate weekly reports for me on anything close to this topic. find people who are working on something similar. and not just people talking about it but people who achieve results and that have genuine insights. im not looking for people who preach abt how important smth is, im looking for reports that share real insights and solutions in this problem space as well as people who are working on it

I\'m also particularly interested in new methods where we dont just use vector similarity but use metadata, or descriptions and an LLM to navigate sections, a folder structure or tree.

Most modern RAG consists of indexing data into a vector database and doing similarity search over this, with tons of optimizations happening all the time. for example, data needs to be extracted and then also "chunked" which means split into smaller pieces. this sounds simple but is actually complex. with code you can chunk by abstract syntax tree parsing, splitting by functions or classes. but in a book or something its not clear. you can split by empty line, but that doesent always work because maybe you seperated two closely related paragraphs etc. i have not seen a solution to this, and i suspect there wont be a general chunking method without agents. in addition, given a question doing vector similarity doesent always point to the related answer. its actually stupid to search docs with vector similarity using a question. you want to navigate the sections of the documentation to get to ur answer. i think vector similarity has its uses but is not a scalable solution. i think the solution is to take a very agentic approach to rag. for example. you have a memory metadata tree. you first insert a repository of code and documentation into this tree. every node in the tree has a description explaining what that node is. when a question comes in an agent will start from the root of the tree and look at descriptions of child nodes to decide what node to navigate to. now in this case itll land on the documentation or repository node. but it cant retrieve that, now it begins dynamizally breaking up the data on the spot. different types of data have diiferent actions we can perform on them to break them up. we can do abstract syntax tree parsing to find something we want in the repo, keyword search in the docs or repo, or vector similarity on the docs. the agent searches the nodes for the answer and returns it. now those nodes are partially broken up and all the actions it performed searching are saved as child nodes with edges being the action performed to get that child node. in this manner the data is intelligently chunked.
