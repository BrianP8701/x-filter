I need these questions answered and these tasks done:

Questions:

- [ ] What exactly is filter stream in x api v2?
- [ ] What features and things can we do in tweet search? 
- [ ] What other features might be useful?
- [ ] Decide on what the UX should be. CLI or X DMs? I think the interface isn't as important and it'd be better if we focus on capabilities and reliability

Tasks:

- [ ] On your own figure out and get some basic successful api calls
- [ ] Implement the XWrapper class. make all api calls async methods. Add docstrings in each method. Add unit tests.
