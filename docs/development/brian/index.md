journal thingy

okay so we're going to have two types of interfaces into using xfilter.

the first option is a conversational workflow where the ai extracts the filter things from the convo as well as guides the user through the primary prompt, filter prompt and report guide. most importantly the bot can help u refine your prompts here

the second option is an interface where u can skip the conversation and directly set the parameters
